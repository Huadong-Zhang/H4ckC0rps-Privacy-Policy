                    <strong>H4ckC0rps</strong> ("the Game") is developed and published by <strong>RIT MAGIC Spell Studios</strong>.

                    The Game may request certain permissions on your device (such as access to storage) solely for the purpose of ensuring the Game functions correctly (e.g., saving game settings or local progress). 
                    These permissions are not used to collect personal data or track your activity outside of the Game application.
